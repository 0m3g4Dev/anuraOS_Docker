# Overriding initrd and kernel(Extended)

In the event that you should need to override/manually add the initrd and kernel, remember to keep track of the file names of initrd and vmlinuz in build/images/debian-boot/. 

The names will most likely be in the folowing format: initrd.img-6.1.0-11-686 and vmlinuz-6.1.0-11-686
