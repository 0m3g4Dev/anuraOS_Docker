The Chide naming scheme according to raff.

"I've decided a simple formula to determine which chide you are using
Start at zero
Remove the first 5 letters of the string (chidenewnew becomes newnew)
Divide the number of letters by 3 and add 1 
That's the version of chide you are using
It's very simple
Chide is chide 1
Chidenew is chide 2
Chidenewnew is chide 3
Chidenewnewnew is chide 4"
