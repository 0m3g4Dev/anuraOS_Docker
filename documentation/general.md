# Getting started

To set up an anuraOS instance, you must first install nodejs, ts-node, and debootstrap.

Run `npm install` in both the root of the repo and in /server/.

Run `tsc` after every change to rebuild the files and apply changes.

TODO: write more about setting up an instance once the makefile has the rootfs bit
